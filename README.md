# Challenge-Two

## Prerequisites
    This program does not require prerequisites. It is a webpage available for all to view. 

## Description
  This is an interactive page designed to showcase the portfolio of Shane Black. The webpage features a header with navigation links to webpage topics: "About Me", "Projects", "Resume", and "Contact Me."
  The page also provides links to my Indeed profile which has my resume and work experience, my GitGub to see projects past and present, and, for contacting, to my LinkedIn and email address.

  ## Deployment
  Open "Index.html" in a browser window.

## Challenges faced
    Challenges faced included getting the main image of the page to display in the middle exactly how I wanted it without moving the other items in the Header. Additional challenges occurred when first attempting to adjust the layout of the boxes within the webpage.
